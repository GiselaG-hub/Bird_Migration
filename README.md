## Project Design

The objective of this project is to gather and analyze bird data related to bird migration throughout the United States and parts of Canada. This research will look at data from different regions (Central Highlands, East Coast, Lower West Coast, Northern Highlands, other interior Highlands, and the Upper West Coast) within the United States and Canada. Focused on our top 10 bird species, American Coot, Northern Pintail, Northern Shoveler, Generic Scaup, Blue-winged or Cinnamon Teal, American Green-winged Teal, American Wigeon, Generic Whisling-Duck, Redhead, and Gadwall. Our questions are; over time, what do we see with bird migration? Where do they travel? Are they traveling to the same location each year? With our interactive website and cleaning of data, users will be able to answer these questions on their own.
